# Product-Management
I completed the 4-month long Nanodegree program on Product Management by Udacity. The product was for LinkedIn by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences.
Through the program, I developed:

1. Pitch a product vision
2. Run a design sprint
3. Manage a product development process
4. Launch the product
